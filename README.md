## Haaretz Frontend Modules

These packages are managed with [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) and organized like so:

* [Apps](packages/apps) – React-powered sites.
  * [haaretz.co.il](packages/apps/haaretz.co.il) – Site app for the Hebrew edition of Haaretz.
* [Components](packages/components) – Collections of React components.
  * [htz-components](packages/components/htz-components) – Components and other shared parts.
* [Libraries](packages/libs) – Helpers, utilities, and any other shared code.
  * [htz-react-base](packages/libs/htz-react-base) – Development helpers.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo:

```console
$ git@github.com:Haaretz/htz-frontend.git
$ cd htz-frontend
```

Use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install Lerna:

```console
$ yarn
```

Now use Lerna to set up the managed packages:

```console
$ yarn run bootstrap
```

Interdependent projects managed in the same monorepo will be symlinked.

Then work on whichever package(s) you like:

```console
$ cd packages/components/htz-components
$ yarn run styleguide
```

## Scripts

These are found in [package.json](package.json) and may be run with `yarn run <script>` or `npm run run <script>`.

### bootstrap

Install the dependencies for each package, and symlink any package found in the `packages` directory if the dependency version matches.

### format

Run the [format](packages/libs/htz-react-base#format) script in every package.

### lint

Run the [lint](packages/libs/htz-react-base#lint) script in every package.

### sync

Set the dependency versions for each matching package based on the `syncDependencies` field of [package.json](package.json), in order to make across-the-board upgrades.
