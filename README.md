## Packages

These packages are managed with [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) and organized like so:

* [Apps](packages/apps) – React-powered sites.
  * [haaretz.co.il](packages/apps/haaretz.co.il) – Site app for the Hebrew edition of Haaretz.
* [Components](packages/components) – Collections of React components.
  * [htz-components](packages/components/htz-components) – Components and other shared parts.
* [Libraries](packages/libs) – Helpers, utilities, and any other shared code.
  * [htz-react-base](packages/libs/htz-react-base) – Development helpers.
  * [htz-react-server](packages/libs/htz-react-server) – Application server.

## Documentation

* For help with individual packages, use the links to those packages above.
* For general documentation, see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 8.0.0 or higher.
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) 1.0.0 or higher.

### Setup

Clone this repo:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:Haaretz/htz-frontend.git
$ cd htz-frontend
```

Use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install Lerna and other dependencies:

```console
$ yarn
```

Now use Lerna to set up the managed packages:

```console
$ yarn run bootstrap
```

Interdependent packages managed in the same monorepo will be symlinked.

Then work on whichever package(s) you like:

```console
$ cd packages/components/htz-components
$ yarn run styleguide
```


## Authoring Packages

### Adding and removing npm dependencies

Thanks to Yarn Workspaces and Lerna, adding (installing) npm dependencies inside
each of our different packages Just Works™, taking care of hoisting and managing
common dependencies.

However, there is currently [a bug](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/4334)
that occurs when running `yarn remove` inside a workspace directory.
Until this is resolved, a temporary workaround for uninstalling dependencies
would be to manually remove the undesired dependency from the workspace’s `package.json`
and run `yarn` from the root directory.

### Lifecycle scripts

If your package is consumed as a dependency, it should include the standard
lifecycle script `prepare` to perform any necessary build tasks. This will
often look like (in `package.json`):

```json
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "npm run build"
  }
```

* In lifecycle scripts, you should run tasks with `npm`, because anyone might
  be installing it from the public npm registry, and they don’t necessarily have
  Yarn installed.
* Apps usually don’t need to be built in a lifecycle script, because they are not
  consumed as dependencies. Instead, they should be built upon deployment.

## Scripts

These are found in the root [package.json](package.json) and may be run with
`yarn run <script>` or `npm run <script>`. If you are looking for the individual
package scripts provided by `htz-react-base`, [see its README](packages/libs/htz-react-base).

### bootstrap

Run `clean`, then install the dependencies for each package, and symlink any
package found in the `packages` directory if the dependency version matches.

### clean

Remove the `node_modules` directory, built distribution files, and Jest cache
directory for each package.

### docs

Add or update the *Table of Contents* section in any Markdown file with section
headings. For best results, move the primary document heading and description
to just before the generated table of contents:

```markdown
# Document Title

Brief description.

<!-- START doctoc -->
...
```

### flow
Type-check all packages with flow. Initialize uninitialized packages.

### format

Format files in the root package, then run the [format](packages/libs/htz-react-base#format)
script in every package.

### lint

Lint files in the root package, then run the [lint](packages/libs/htz-react-base#lint)
script in every package.

### sync

Set the dependency versions for each matching package based on the `syncDependencies`
field of [package.json](package.json), in order to make across-the-board upgrades.

### update

Like `bootstrap`, but doesn’t `clean` first.

### update-packages-scripts

Sync the `scripts` property in each package with the latest version of `htz-scripts`
